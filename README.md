Instructions on how to run and compile my project.
1. Create a New Project:

Open Visual Studio and choose "Create a new project."
Select "Console App (.NET Framework)".bGive your project a name (e.g., RecipeManager) and click "Create."
2. Add the Code Files:

Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer window (usually on the right side).
Select "Add" -> "Class" (or "Item" depending on your version).
In the "Add New Item" window, choose "C# Class (.cs)" and name it accordingly (e.g., Recipe.cs, Ingredient.cs, Program.cs).
Repeat this step for all three class files (Recipe, Ingredient, and Program).
Copy and paste the code snippets you have for each class (including comments) into their respective class files.

3. Build and Run:

Click the "Build" menu and choose "Build Solution." This will compile your code and check for errors.
If there are no errors (or after fixing any identified errors), click the green "Run" button (or navigate to Debug -> Start Without Debugging) to run the program.
4. User Interaction:

The program will display a menu with options for entering recipe details, displaying the recipe, scaling the recipe, resetting the scale, clearing the recipe data, and exiting.
Follow the instructions on the screen to interact with the program and manage your recipes.
